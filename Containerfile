### BASE IMAGE
## Set in image-template.env. The default keeps a plain `podman build` working, keep it in sync.
ARG BASE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-nvidia-open:stable

# Allow build scripts to be referenced without being copied into the final image
FROM scratch AS ctx
COPY build_files /
COPY system_files /system_files
COPY cosign.pub /cosign.pub

# Base image, pinned by `just build`
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}

### [IM]MUTABLE /opt
## Some bootable images, like Fedora, have /opt symlinked to /var/opt, in order to
## make it mutable/writable for users. However, some packages write files to this directory,
## thus its contents might be wiped out when bootc deploys an image, making it troublesome for
## some packages. Eg, google-chrome, docker-desktop.
##
## Uncomment the following line if one desires to make /opt immutable and be able to be used
## by the package manager.

# RUN rm /opt && mkdir /opt

### SIGNATURE POLICY
## Repository of this image, passed by `just build`. build.sh writes it into policy.json.
ARG IMAGE_REPOSITORY

### MODIFICATIONS
## make modifications desired in your image and install packages by modifying the build.sh script
## the following RUN directive does all the things required to run "build.sh" as recommended.

RUN --mount=type=bind,from=ctx,source=/,target=/ctx \
    --mount=type=cache,dst=/var/cache \
    --mount=type=cache,dst=/var/log \
    --mount=type=tmpfs,dst=/tmp \
    /ctx/build.sh

### LINTING
## Verify final image and contents are correct.
RUN bootc container lint
